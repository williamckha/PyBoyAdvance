PyBoy Advance is a Game Boy Advance emulator written in Python, with [Cython](https://cython.org/) declarations for compiling to C.

>[!WARNING]
> This is experimental software and under development. Some GBA hardware features are not yet implemented and some games may not function properly. 

## Getting started

Install PyBoy Advance with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install pyboy-advance
```

You will need to provide a Game Boy Advance BIOS. Normatt's open source BIOS is supported and
available [here](https://github.com/Nebuleon/ReGBA/blob/master/bios/gba_bios.bin).

Launch PyBoy Advance from the terminal:

```bash
$ pyboy_advance --bios /path/to/bios.bin game_rom.gba
```

Or import and use it in your Python scripts:

```python
from pyboy_advance import PyBoyAdvance

emulator = PyBoyAdvance(rom="game_rom.gba", bios="/path/to/bios.bin")
emulator.run()
```

## Performance

PyBoy Advance is written in "pure" Python and can technically be run with [PyPy](https://pypy.org/) or even CPython (though games 
will be virtually unplayable with the latter). To achieve practical performance, we use [Cython](https://cython.org/) 
to statically type our Python code and generate efficient C code from it. This allows us to build PyBoy Advance as a 
Python C extension module, significantly improving execution speed.
